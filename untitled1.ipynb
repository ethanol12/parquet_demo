    "TIMESTAMP\n",
    "In data annotated with the TIMESTAMP logical type, each value is a single int64 number that can be decoded into year, month, day, hour, minute, second and subsecond fields using calculations detailed below. Please note that a value defined this way does not necessarily correspond to a single instant on the time-line and such interpretations are allowed on purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TIMESTAMP type has two type parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "isAdjustedToUTC must be either true or false.\n",
    "unit must be one of MILLIS, MICROS or NANOS. This list is subject to potential expansion in the future. Upon reading, unknown unit-s must be handled as unsupported features (rather than as errors in the data files).\n",
    "Instant semantics (timestamps normalized to UTC)\n",
    "A TIMESTAMP with isAdjustedToUTC=true is defined as the number of milliseconds, microseconds or nanoseconds (depending on the unit parameter being MILLIS, MICROS or NANOS, respectively) elapsed since the Unix epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC. Each such value unambiguously identifies a single instant on the time-line."
